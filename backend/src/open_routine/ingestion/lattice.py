"""The routine lattice: the fixed grid every class snaps to.

The DIU routine is not a free-form calendar. It is a 6 x 6 lattice -- six working
days by six fixed 90-minute slots -- and every class occupies exactly one cell.

Two consequences drive the whole system:

1. Ingestion is a *grid walk*, not layout inference.
2. Occupancy is decided by string equality on the slot label. Because slots are
   atomic, two classes can never partially overlap, so no interval arithmetic is
   needed anywhere. Keep it that way.
